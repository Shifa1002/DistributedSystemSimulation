# Distributed System Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a distributed system using Python and SQLite. It involves creating and populating three SQLite databases (Users, Products, Orders) through a Python script. The simulation also handles threading for simultaneous data insertion and includes validation for the data.

### Key Features:
- **Users, Products, and Orders Databases**: Three separate databases that store information about users, products, and orders.
- **Threading**: Multiple threads are used to insert data simultaneously, improving performance.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that the data being inserted is valid, including checks for valid email format, valid price range, and valid quantity.
